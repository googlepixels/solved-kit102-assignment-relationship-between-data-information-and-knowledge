This unit will explain the relationship between data, information and knowledge and introduce a number of different methods/tools for managing, storing, securing, modelling, visualizing and analyzing. This unit will provide an understanding of how data can be manipulated to meet the needs of users. Changing data into information can be accomplished with a range of tools, including XML, SQL, spreadsheeting and data visualisation. This unit introduces the techniques to enable the students to use these tools for managing data, creating information and allowing knowledge development. Overarching the whole unit is the importance of data security and how it can be achieved. This unit concludes by introducing the concepts behind managing big data in response to global trends of capturing all available data due to inexpensive storage.

The University recognises that hazard identification, risk assessment and controls are a critical part of everyday work. Figure 1 shows the risk management process.

Prior to commencing any laboratory and/or field activity on or off campus in this unit you are required to;

identify hazards – find out what could cause harm

assess risks if necessary – understand the nature of the harm that could be caused by the hazard, how serious the harm could be and the likelihood of it happening

control risks – implement the most effective control measure that is reasonably practicable in the circumstances

review control measures to ensure they are working as planned.

A formal Risk Assessment must be completed as part of any project proposal/plan prior to commencing any practical activities. Your supervisor will assist you in identifying potential hazards and assessing risks for your project and will assist you with sign off on any documentation.

Use the Risk Assessment template contained within the UTAS Project and Task Risk Management Minimum Standard. A word version of this form is available from the UTAS WHS webpage and in MyLO. Note that risk assessments (RA) are not required for activities that are considered routine and a current Safe Work Procedure (SWP) is already in place to manage the project/task.

For additional advice and assistance see the local WHS Contact or Health and Safety Representative (HSR) within your School/Institution, and/or consult with other staff.

<strong><em>These expectations are in addition to those specified in relevant University regulations.</em></strong>

<h2>Plagiarism</h2>

In your written work you will need to support your ideas by referring to scholarly literature, works of art and/or inventions. It is important that you understand how to correctly refer to the work of others, and how to maintain academic integrity. Failure to appropriately acknowledge the ideas of others constitutes academic dishonesty (plagiarism), a matter considered by the University of Tasmania as a serious offence.

Unless specifically stated in the specification of the assessment item provided on the unit website, it is required that:

work submitted by a student is the work of that student alone OR

where the assessment item is to be completed by a group of students, the work submitted by the group of students is the work of that group of students alone.

While students are encouraged to discuss the assignments in this unit and to engage in active learning from each other, it is important that they are also aware of the University’s policy on plagiarism. Plagiarism is taking and using someone else’s thoughts, writings or inventions and representing them as your own; for example downloading an essay wholly or in part from the internet, copying another student’s work or using an author’s words or ideas without citing the source.

“<strong>Plagiarism</strong> is a form of cheating. It is taking and using someone else’s thoughts, writings or inventions and representing them as your own; for example, using an author’s words without putting them in quotation marks and citing the source, using an author’s ideas without proper acknowledgment and citation, copying another student’s work.

If you have any doubts about how to refer to the work of others in your assignments, please consult your lecturer or tutor for relevant referencing guidelines. You may also find the Academic Honesty site on MyLO of some assistance.

The intentional copying of someone else’s work as one’s own is a serious offence punishable by penalties that may range from a fine or deduction/cancellation of marks and, in the most serious of cases, to exclusion from a unit, a course or the University. Details of penalties that can be imposed are available in the Ordinance of Student Discipline – Part 3 Academic <a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/23991/Ordinance-9-Student-Discipline.pdf">Misconduct, see </a><a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/23991/Ordinance-9-Student-Discipline.pdf">www.utas.edu.au/</a><a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/23991/Ordinance-9-Student-Discipline.pdf">__</a><a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/23991/Ordinance-9-Student-Discipline.pdf">data/assets/pdf</a><a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/23991/Ordinance-9-Student-Discipline.pdf">_</a><a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/23991/Ordinance-9-Student-Discipline.pdf">file/0006/23991/Ordinance-9-StudentDiscipline.pdf</a><a href="http://www.utas.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/23991/Ordinance-9-Student-Discipline.pdf">.</a>
